10,Is Google and YouTube Behind Hillary's Campaign?,"After posting an article titled ""Hillary Clinton Wants a Strong Russia. Wait, what did she say?"" my YouTube account was mysteriously wiped out. The video I had used suddenly wouldn’t work, though it was still available on the YouTube site. Has anyone else experienced this strange behavior? Is this the kind of censorship we can expect if Hillary Clinton becomes president?
Some believe Google and YouTube, like much of the mainstream media, are biased toward Hillary, with nearly every Google News story skewed in her favor and against Trump. There’s speculation that the media, big corporations, and even Hollywood are pushing a pro-Clinton agenda, much like how Drudge supports Trump.
Others argue that this kind of manipulation extends beyond media bias, with fears that policies like gun control and the rise of ""dictatorship"" under Clinton are being forced upon us. They see it as a path toward socialism, driven by corporate interests and a global agenda. Conspiracy theories suggest that these forces, along with the UN and certain immigrant groups, could threaten American freedoms, much like the predictions made about 9/11.
